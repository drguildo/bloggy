Requirements
------------

The only requirements are the Python interpreter and the sqlite3 module.
Oh, and a web server, obviously. These instructions will cover the
Apache web server as that's the most popular and also the biggest pain
in the arse to configure.

Installation
------------

Extract Bloggy to a directory that is visible to your web server, e.g.
the public_html directory in your home directory.

Configuration
-------------

Configuration directives are located in config.py in the directory you
placed Bloggy.

The directory the database is to be created in needs to be writable by
the web server.

If you don't want everyone to be able to post to your blog you'll need
to secure post.cgi somehow. This will vary depending on the web server
you're using and your needs. Use your brain.

If you're using Apache, one possible solution is to place the following
in a file called .htaccess in the same directory as post.cgi:

<Files post.cgi>
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Password Required"
    AuthUserFile /path/to/.htpasswd
    Require valid-user
</Files>

You'll obviously need to create a .htpasswd file containing your
authentication credentials. This can be done using the htpasswd command.
