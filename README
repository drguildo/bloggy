The directory the database is to be created in needs to be writable by
the web server.

If you don't want everyone to be able to post to your blog you'll need
to secure post.cgi somehow. This will vary depending on the web server
you're using and your needs. Use your brain.

If you're using Apache, one possible solution is to place the following
in a file called .htaccess in the same directory as post.cgi:

<Files post.cgi>
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Password Required"
    AuthUserFile /path/to/.htpasswd
    Require valid-user
</Files>

You'll obviously also need to create a .htpasswd file containing your
authentication credentials. This can be done using the htpasswd command.
